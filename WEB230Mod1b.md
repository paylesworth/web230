# WEB230: JavaScript 1

# Module 1B: Program Structure

---

## Expressions

- Expressions are bits of code that evaluate to something
- Expressions can be combined

```text
1
3+4
(3+4) * (5-2)
```

---

## Statements

- Statements should end in a semicolon (`;`)

```text
1;
3+4;
(3+4) * (5-2);
```

---

## Bindings

- A variable is a named place to store a value
  - It is "Bound" to the name
- The `let` keyword creates a new variable
- Only use `let` once when creating the variable

```text
let dog = "Fido";
dog = "Rex";
```

---

## `var` and `const`

- `var` is an older way to declare variables
  - now `let` is preferred
- `const` declares variables that are "constant" meaning they cannot be assigned new values
- more later

---

## Binding Names

- JavaScript has words that cannot be used for variable names
- Some of these are keywords in JavaScript, some are reserved for future versions

`break` `case` `catch` `class` `const` `continue` `debugger` `default` `delete` `do` `else` `enum` `export` `extends` `false` `finally` `for` `function` `if` `implements` `import` `in` `instanceof` `interface` `let` `new` `null` `package` `private` `protected` `public` `return` `static` `super` `switch` `this` `throw` `true` `try` `typeof` `var` `void` `while` `with` `yield`

---

## The Environment

- collection of variables and their values that already exist
- they are variables that are part of the language standard
  - allow access to the surrounding system

---

## Functions

- A function is a piece of program wrapped in a value
- These variables have the type `function` and can be run:

```text
alert("Good morning!");
```

- Executing a function is called _invoking_ or _calling_ it

---

## The `console.log` Function

- `console.log` is a function that will display values
- In web browsers there is a console where you can see these messages

```text
console.log("JavaScript is fun so far!");
```

- The period is not part of the name
  - more in chapter 4

---

## Return Values

- Writing text to the screen is a _side effect_
- Some functions produce a value
- When a function produces a value, it is said to _return_ that value

```text
Math.min(4,6,3,1);   // returns 1
```

- We will write functions in chapter 3

---

## Prompt and Confirm

- We can also ask the user to approve something
- Returns a boolean

```text
confirm("Are you sure?");
```

- Or provide a value
- Returns a string

```text
prompt("How many would you like?", "4");
```

---

## Control Flow

- Statements can execute one after the other

```text
let num = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));
alert ("Your number is the square root of " + num * num);
```

- Each line runs in turn

---

## Conditional Execution

- Programs don't have to run in a linear fashion
- An alternative is _conditional execution_

```text
let num = Number(prompt("Pick a number", ""));

if (!isNaN(num)) {
    alert (" Your number is the square root of " + num * num);
}
```

---

## While and do Loops

- `while` and `do` loops repeat statements

```text
let number = 0;
while (number <= 12) {
    console.log(number);
    number = number + 2;
}
```

---

## Indenting Code

- Indent code inside of blocks (`{...}`)
- Makes programs easier to read
- The computer doesn't care
- Tabs vs spaces!!! The never ending argument!

---

## For Loops

- Counter, test, and increment all in one

```text
for (let num = 0; num <= 12; num = num + 2) {
    console.log(num);
}
```

---

## Breaking out of a Loop

- use the `break` statement to end a loop prematurely

```text
for (let num = 20; ; num++) {
    if (num % 7 == 0)
        break;
    }
}
console.log(num);
```

---

## Updating Bindings Succinctly

- We often update a variable base on its current value

```text
counter = counter + 1;
```

- JavaScript provides a shortcut:

```text
counter +=  1;
```

- Or even:

```text
counter++;
```

---

## Dispatching on a Value With switch

```text
switch (prompt("What is the weather like?")) {
    case "rainy":
        console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella.");
        break;
    case "sunny":
        console.log("Dress lightly.");
    case "cloudy":
        console.log("Go outside.");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("Unknown weather type!");
        break;
}
```

---

## Capitalization

- Variable names may not contain spaces
- Often have more than one word

```text
fuzzylittleturtle
fuzzy_little_turtle
FuzzyLittleTurtle
fuzzyLittleTurtle
```

- Last one preferred in JavaScript
- Called _Camel Case_

---

## Comments

- Two types of comments
- Single line:

```text
// Some note about the program
```

- Multi-line:

```text
/*
A longer note about the program
that goes on and on
*/
```
