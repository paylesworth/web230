## Module 6: Handling Events<br>Part A - Event Handler

---

# Events

- events are interactions with our page
- often initiated by the user
- we can't predict when they will happen

---

# Event Handlers

- JavaScript code that runs when an event occurs
- written as a function
- this function is passed to a method

---

# Events and DOM Nodes

- every DOM Element node can have events associated with it
- use `.addEventListener()`
- first argument is the event name such as `'click'`
- second argument is a callback function (the event handler)

```text
const button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Button clicked.');
});
```

---

## Deleting an Event Handler

- use a named callback function
- this provides a function reference that we can pass to `.removeEventListener()`

```text
const button = document.querySelector('button');
function once() {
  alert('Done.');
  button.removeEventListener('click', once);
}
button.addEventListener('click', once);
```
